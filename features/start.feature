@API-12
Start

Narrative:
As an API-consumer
I want to get an overview of the APIs in the catalog
So that I can learn to know the catalog

Acceptance Criteria: (presented as Scenarios)

Scenario 1: Start page
When the user has selected the API-pane
Then a list of the first 50 APIs are shown
And the list should be ordered by provenance field (1-NASJONAL, 2-VEDTAK, 3-BRUKER, 4-TREDJEPART, 5-UKJENT)
And each API-description is shown as a summary box
